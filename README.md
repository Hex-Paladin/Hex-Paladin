### Hi there, I'm Bryan Snyder

I'm a soon-to-be graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, deeply passionate about programming and game design. I specialize in C# but also enjoy exploring other technologies and languages that enhance my ability to create and innovate in the tech space.

During my academic career, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from game development, .NET web development, and theoretical computer science, some of which you can explore right here on GitHub. My educational background and projects have given me a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and software engineering.

Outside of coding, I'm an big fan of Dungeons and Dragons, Magic the Gathering, and outdoor activities like hiking and camping. I find that these hobbies not only fulfill my personal life but also enrich my professional creativity and problem-solving skills.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects or discussing new ideas. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together or if you have any questions!

Check out my projects below, and let's get in touch!
